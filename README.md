Welcome to the "Exploring React Components within Angular" repository! In this project, I've 🕵️‍♂️ experimented with the intriguing possibility of using React components within an Angular application. The aim was to uncover the benefits and challenges of this unique approach to frontend development. :rocket:

## Project Overview (项目概述) :clipboard:

Throughout this repository, I 🚀 have explored the integration of React components into an existing Angular application. By delving into this innovative technique, I sought to harness the full potential of React's component-based architecture alongside Angular's powerful ecosystem. Whether you're an Angular expert or just starting your journey, this project offers valuable insights into expanding the boundaries of Angular development.

## Automatic Deployment (自动部署) :rocket:

To make things even more exciting, I've set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the project after every successful push to the `master` branch. The application will be magically 🪄 deployed to the following URL: [https://weiz16.github.io/angular-react](https://weiz16.github.io/angular-react) :sparkles: :rocket:
